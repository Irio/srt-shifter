<p>How many times you downloaded a movie that you couldn't find a perfect synchronized subtitle to watch it?</p>

<p>SRT Shifter is an open-source command-line tool that fixes the timming of your SubRip files!</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>On the command-line, run the executable inside the <strong>bin</strong> to get more detailed usage information.</p>

<pre><code>$ ./srtshifter --help
</code></pre>

<p>This example generates a new srt file called new_sub.srt, with 2.5 milliseconds shifted ahead 
from its original_sub.srt file.</p>

<pre><code>$ strshifter -o ADD -t 2.5 original_sub.srt new_sub.srt
</code></pre>

<h2>Support</h2>

<p>This tool doesn't work on Windows :P</p>

<h2>Future ideas and "to do"s'</h2>

<ol>
<li>Create a self-instalation script</li>
<li>Add Windows support</li>
</ol><h2>How to contribute</h2>
